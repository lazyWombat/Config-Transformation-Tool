This is a fork from Config Transformation Tool project on [codeplex](http://ctt.codeplex.com)

XDT Transformation tool is a command tool based on [XDT (web.config) transform engine](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2013/01/10/xdt-web-config-transform-engine-released-on-nuget.aspx), which allows you to run XDT transformation on any XML files.

Scott Guthrie: *"In most real-world deployment scenarios, the web.config file you use for development is different than the one you use for production deployment. Typically you want to change environment settings like database connection-strings, making sure debug is turned off, and enabling custom errors so that end-users (and hackers) donâ€™t see the internals of your application."*
